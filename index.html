      <div class="caption"> This is the start of my journey!, I was born in the United States but after being a few weeks old, I was sent to Mexico to be baptized and as a result lived I lived there for 3 years. </div>

      <div class="caption"> Once I moved to mexico I was sent to private kindergarden soon after my arrival there, I got suspended for hitting a kid with the metal swings. I don't tend to remember much of my time in Mexico except for this insident. </div>

    <div id="serenomodal" class="modal">
      <span class="close">&times;</span>
      <div class="caption"> Being a Mexican family of 3 I moved a lot during my childhood. El Sereno Elementary School Is my first stop, I didn't enjoy this school because the lunch sucked, I saw my friends get picked on, and my mom didn't let me go out and play outside of school. </div>

    <img id="alhambra" src="images/alhambra_elemen.png" alt="alhambra elementary">
    <div id="alhambramodal" class="modal">
      <span class="close">&times;</span>
      <div class="caption"> Alhambra was a nice school I remember my mom would walk me to school every morning because the school was 5 miles away and no bus passed by our house. I liked how during our walks she would tell me stories and I would end up hearing the same story over 10x in the course of a year, but nevertheless the ending still fasinated me. </div>
    </div>

    <img id="terrace" src="images/terrace_elemen.png" alt="city terrace elementary">
    <div id="terracemodal" class="modal">
      <span class="close">&times;</span>
      <div class="caption"> Being the new kid again didn't help me at all because I always had to make new friends and try to enter a social cirlce where everyone new eachother since the first grade. I guess this is what helps me be social now a days; the constant getting to know poeple became easy for me while some still struggle with it. I still didn't manage to make much friends so I be-friended the special ed kids at my school because no one would play with them, I got to say they had a lot of joy packed in them. </div>

    <div id="serenomodal2" class="modal">
      <span class="close">&times;</span>
      <div class="caption"> Once again back in El Sereno but this time it was their middle school. I hated this school it was like a prison, the teachers had negative marks with a lot of parents, and fights happened on the regular. Because of the high level of gang activity involved the security guards and our dean carried handcuffs in a Middle School!!!. I saw 2 kids get arrested over the course of 3 years and in 3 fights i witness kids brought knives and bb guns to school. I didn't do much in this school expect walk home right after 3:30pm </div>

    <img id="highschool" src="images/highschool.png" alt="marc and eva stern">
    <div id="highmodal" class="modal">
      <span class="close">&times;</span>
      <div class="caption"> Highschool is where I made most of my friends, It was a fun time for me because after moving much of 2-9 grade my parents finally had a place where to settle down for good. It was a fun 4 years because I joined the rugby team, I made long lasting friendships, and my parents started to give me more liberty. One thing I didn't like was how our school was just one building inside the Cal State LA campus </div>
    </div>

    <img id="rugby" src="images/rugby.png" alt="rugby team">
    <div id="rugbymodal" class="modal">
      <span class="close">&times;</span>
      <div class="caption"> Man rugby was the sport for me. I never liked soccer! I didn't watch much basketball, and football was too slow for me. I got introduced into rugby by a close friend of mine and he told me to go to practice to get a feel of the game. After my first score I was hooked and decided to join the team. </div>

    <img id="eastbay" src="images/eastbay.png" alt="college">
    <div id="eastmodal" class="modal">
      <span class="close">&times;</span>
      <div class="caption"> WOOooo College! I wanted to move far away from home but not too far where the plane ticket to get home was really expensive but just far enough where my parents couldn't drive up constantly. College life was not what my councelors told me it would be or what the moveis depicted it as, I don't think anything could have prepared me for college except going to it. </div>

    <img id="tke" src="images/tke.png" alt="frat">
    <div id="tkemodal" class="modal">
      <span class="close">&times;</span>
      <div class="caption"> The third qt of my sophmore year most of my close friends that I thought would stick with me through college left or dropped out. Because of this I decided to join a greek org and I'm glad I did because It gave me the college experience that I was looking for but not only that It also brought me people that will have my back in the best and worst times. </div>
